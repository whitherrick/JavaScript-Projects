Pizza Menu:
This project created a menu for ordering pizza. The user has the option of different sizes or toppings and then it calculates a total price for the order.

Tic-Tac-Toe Game:
In this classic game of tic-tac-toe the program rolls the dice to decide which player goes first. The user is playing the game against the computer which randomly select a square for it's turn. The winner is shown with a line draw through the marks and playing a winning song.

Calculator:
This is a calculator that can use basic math functions to add, subtract, multiply and divide.
